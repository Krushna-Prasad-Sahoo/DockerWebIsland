# DockerWebIsland
I have created a simple Web UI & hosted on Apache Web Server. But the interesting part is you can interact your docker server running behind & execute almost all docker commands, as well as see the output on the Webpage itself. I have named the page as #DockerWebIslandðŸ™ƒ.

### Instructions
-> put index.html in document root (for eg: /var/www/html)<br>
-> put p.py in /var/www/cgi-bin<br>
-> make the p.py file executable<br>
-> change the ip in index.html file<br>
-> give ALL permission to docker user & apache user in /etc/sudoers file

Do give a watch the [video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/krushna-prasad_connections-dockerwebisland-vimaldaga-activity-6840500062057992192-pCS8) where I have demonstrated all the mentioned implementations.
